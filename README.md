### Hello, my name is Guilherme 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! :D

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Intern in Software Development
- 🌱 I’m learning to work with C++, Java and C# languages.
- 🤔 I'm very curious so, recently, as a way to learn more about programming I entered in the world of developing some games.
- This unites a love that I always had and ends up helping me at work.
